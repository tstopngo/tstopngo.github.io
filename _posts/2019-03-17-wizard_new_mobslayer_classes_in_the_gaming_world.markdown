When I first started learning about Classes I took me a bit to wrap my head around the concept until it struck me when I was in the character creation screen of an MMORPG I had not played in awhile. I went through my notes and tried to think about how each thing we learned about classes related to this character I was creating, so I wrote each concept down one at a time. 

## 1.  Classes in the MMORPG world
       
The first thing you learn about Classes is they are like blueprints or templates and act as a factory in creating instances. When you first start the game you get a to pick a race or class like Wizard, Assassin, Knight, Priest, etc. These classes are like blueprints for you to create the character and make it your own.

I could create a one Knight that I intend to use for tanking and protecting the team named "TankyTank". TankyTank is not the brightest crayon in the box but they sure do know how to protect. Fooling around aside, TankyTank is consdered to be an *instance* of the Knight class. 

Let's suppose I want to make another Knight made for pure damage and speed to take down bosses named "KillerTank". KillerTank is all about moving on with life and you die good luck to you. Again, KillerTank is also a *instance* of the Knight class.

I could continue to make more instances of Knights but I might have to pay more money to the game to do so, so I will stick with two for now.
			 
## 2.  Classes have skills

The next thing we learn is that Classes is that they have instances methods that each instance is able to use these methods upon being created. This is similar to the concept of pre-set skills. In my previous example, when I first created TankyTank and KillerTank they will both start off with basic skills like "Sword Stabby" and "Shield Block". That's great for basic survival in fighting crazy mobs...like this guy:

While my Knight Class can do sword stabs and shield blocks my Wizard Class would not have these skills or methods, instead they would have skills like "Cast Spel"l or "Play Dead". 


## 3.  Classes all start off with basic stats

Classes can also be inititalized upon being created with a basic data to start with. In my example, this woud be their names. When you create the new Knight you must give it a name otherwise there is no way to identify that it is your character in the game. Also, all Knights must start off with basic stats such as maybe Strength:  5, Defense: 5, Intelligence: 1, and Dexterity: 2. We can't have some Knights that are stronger than others from the get go, but this can be customized and their numbers can be worked on and adjusted later.


## 4.  Individual characters can learn a new skills

Finally the last concept from my notes, each instance can have methods that are local to them. Our "TankyTank" Knight can learn a new skill called "Ultimate Defense", where they sacrifice their entire life to save the team from disaster. Meanwhile, KillerTank Knight invests in a skill called "Wreck the Boss" that deals a ton of damage to the boss at the expense of the team getting wiped out, but that's ok they may or may not kill the boss. Both of these skills are unique to each Knight much like a local method to the instance.
